globs: *.md

- Begin every lesson with a YAML frontmatter block enclosed in --- lines.
- Include these required fields:
  - title: A concise, descriptive title (e.g., "Debugging HTML Code").
  - tags: A list of relevant keywords as a YAML array (e.g., - debugging, - web development, - html/css).
  - description: A short, punchy summary (1-2 sentences) that hooks the reader and previews the content (e.g., "Master HTML debugging with our essential guide! Learn to prevent errors and fix common mistakes efficiently.").
- Keep the description casual and enticing, avoiding dry or overly technical phrasing.
- Example:

```yaml
