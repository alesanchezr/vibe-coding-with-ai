- Use ## (H2) headings for main sections like “Introduction,” “Tools You’ll Need,” or “Common Pitfalls.”
- Use ### (H3) headings for subsections under the main ones.
- Follow a clear flow: begin with an overview, dive into details (prevention, tools, examples), and wrap up with a summary or next steps.
- Keep each section short and focused—don’t let it ramble.
